## Reading Reflections on Git and Github

  *Git is DVCS (A Distributed Version Control Systems)that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. It keeps track of all your files you changed each time you commit changes. Git creates an updated version of the file with the new changes while saving the previous version so that you can compare and track the changes made between the previous versions and the new version with the additional changes.*

  ### Some Benefits of Git
  
  1. **Loss of Data**
  2. **Local Operations** (work on your project even when not online or on a vpn)
  3. **Track your changes**
  4. **Cloning**
  5. **Git Remote** allows you to view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding shot names.
